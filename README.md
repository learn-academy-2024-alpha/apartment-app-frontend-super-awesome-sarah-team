# Apartment App

April 2024

Apartment App is a decoupled React and Rails API. It is built with a PostgreSQL database featuring user authentication and authorization using Devise and JWT.

### 📚 Overall Story

Apartment App lists apartments available for rent. A visiting user of the application can see a list of all available apartments. A visiting user can select an apartment listing and see more information about that apartment. In order to list an apartment for rent, a user can create an account and log into the application. When logged in, a user can add an apartment to the list. Logged in users can see a list of all their apartments with the ability to edit or delete their listings.
